I'm a rising senior at the University of Michigan, double majoring in Computer Science and Data Science.

I'm interning this summer as a Software Engineering/Machine Learning Intern at Tektronix in Beaverton, OR.

I am interested in web3 and am actively teaching myself the core concepts and implementing small proof-of-concept projects. I also enjoy competing in hackathons and coming up with "cool" projects.

Data is the oil of the 21st century and I look forward to working with data to solve the problems that face our society today.
